# CS 671D Fall 2024 Final Project

This was my final project for CS 671D (Theory and Algorithms of Machine Learning). I did some data visualizations on a subset of the Rashomon set of sparse decision trees for two datasets, which you can find in the file check_greedy.ipynb in the treefarms folder (most of the other files are the code from the original repo). 
The original repository is here: https://github.com/ubc-systopia/treeFarms
